OFFLINE MAP PLACEHOLDER

This file indicates where the offline_map.jpg should be placed.

To create the offline map image:
1. Take a screenshot of the map at your default location
2. Save it as offline_map.jpg in this directory (frontend/public/)
3. Recommended size: 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels
4. Format: JPEG

Alternatively, you can use a simple grid pattern image for testing.

The map component will automatically use this image when:
- Tile server is unreachable
- User preference "prefer_offline_map" is enabled
- Network is offline
